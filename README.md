# CodTech Data Analysis Internship

This repository contains the work completed as part of the **Data Analysis Internship** at **CodTech**. The internship involves completing four tasks, each focused on a different aspect of data analysis, machine learning, and dashboard development.

## Tasks Overview

1. **Big Data Analysis**
   - Perform analysis on a large dataset using tools like **PySpark** or **Dask** to demonstrate scalability.
   - Deliverable: A script or notebook with insights derived from big data processing.

2. **Predictive Analysis using Machine Learning**
   - Build a machine learning model (e.g., regression or classification) to predict outcomes based on a dataset.
   - Deliverable: A notebook demonstrating feature selection, model training, and evaluation.

3. **Dashboard Development**
   - Create an interactive dashboard using tools like **Tableau**, **Power BI**, or **Dash** to visualize a dataset.
   - Deliverable: A fully functional dashboard with actionable insights.

4. **Sentiment Analysis using NLP**
   - Perform sentiment analysis on textual data (e.g., tweets, reviews) using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.
   - Deliverable: A notebook showcasing data preprocessing, model implementation, and insights.
